MediaKeys is a simple program that runs behinds the scenes,
allowing you to play/pause and change the volume of media
without actually having direct media keys on your keyboard.

It uses the following schematic:

	Ctrl-Up - Volume Up
	Ctrl-Down - Volume Down
	Ctrl-Left - Previous Media
	Ctrl-Right - Next Media
	Ctrl-F11 - Toggle Mute
	Ctrl-F12 - Toggle Play

MediaKeys is licensed under the MIT License, which you should
have received a copy of, along with the program source.

By default, MediaKeys runs at login. If you don't want this 
functionality, remove it from your startup items.
